The bitstream is a 1D boolean array where subtrees are ordered by their level and Morton index within that level and conforms to the boolean array encoding described in the Cesium 3D Metadata specification: https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/blob/3d-tiles-next/specification/Metadata/0.0.0/README.md. Each subtree's availability is determined by a single bit, 1 meaning a subtree exists at that spatial index, and 0 meaning it does not. The depth of the subtree availability tree is `max(ceil(maximumLevel / subtreeDepth), 1)` and the number of elements in the array tree is `(N ^ (subtree_availability_tree_depth + 1) - 1) / (N - 1)` where N is 4 for `QUADTREE` and 8 for `OCTREE`.",
