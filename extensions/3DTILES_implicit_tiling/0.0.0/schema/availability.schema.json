A node availability file exists for each subtree that exists that is not fully available or fully unavailable. The URI of each availability file is substituted with the subtree's global level, x, y, and z (`OCTREE` only). The availability bitstream is a 1D boolean array where nodes are ordered by their level in the subtree and Morton index within that level and conforms to the boolean array encoding described in the Cesium 3D Metadata specification: https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/blob/3d-tiles-next/specification/Metadata/0.0.0/README.md. A node's availability is determined by a single bit, 1 meaning a node exists at that spatial index, and 0 meaning it does not. The number of elements in the array is `X ^ (subtreeDepth + 1) - 1` where X is 4 for `QUADTREE` and 8 for `OCTREE`."
